          Robin was credited in at least 106 roles between 1977 and 2014, these are just a few examples.
        <ul>
          <li><i>Good Morning, Vietnam</i> (1986) - One of his first serious roles that garnered a ton of praise.</li>
          <li><i>Dead Poets Society</i> (1989) - An instant classic</li>
          <li><i>Hook</i> (1991) - Well recieved, but not as well recieved as some of the others in this list.</li>
          <li><i>Popeye</i> (1980) - One of the first roles he's remembered for.</li>
          <li><i>Aladdin</i> (1992) - One of his most famous works, showing off a huge range of vocal talents.</li>
